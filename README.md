# SCI_Benchmark_pipeline
A pipeline to provide benchmarking for Single Cell data integration tools
## Intro
This pipeline was inspired by  [this paper](./Papers_and_refs/SCBIP_paper.pdf)
that   
> benchmarked 16 popular data integration tools on 13 data integration tasks... using 14 metrics to evaluate 
the integration methods on their ability to remove batch effects while conserving biological variation

The actual implementation of it could be found [here](https://github.com/theislab/scib-reproducibility).
## Motivation 
Extensive need of validating and comparing different integration tools as well as their hyper parameters in the lab makes this
project highly up-to-date.This pipeline would allow researchers perform analysis of their integration tools performance.
## Usage 
The pipeline expects an anndata object with normalised and log-transformed counts in ```adata.X``` and counts in ```adata.layers['counts']```.
Data should include different batches and cell types.The output should be ```.h5ad``` with integrated batch data. Using ```scib.metrics.metrics()``` funtion ```scib``` provides 
pandas dataframe with all the parameters for the different metrics.
## Validation
To see whether SCIBP works and does so efficiently unit tests need to be developed.   

| Case study                |    Data    |   Result |
|:--------------------------:|:----------:|:--:|
| integrated samples don't need integration | 1 sample split into 2 batches artificially | dataset should rank higher than those with batch effect (i.e un-integrated 3' and 5' samples)  |
| scib should not differ technical replicates  |  technical replicate samples  | identical samples have the same scib performance |
| scanVI integration of technical variability preserves biological variability |  same samples prepared with different chemistry (Karolinaâ€™s 3' vs 5' project)  | un-integrated samples should produce batch effect, which is removed when dataset is integrated. This should result in higher scib score|
| CRISPRclean depletion preserves biological variability and produces and has higher scib performance |  same samples prepared normally and with jumpcode (JC) processing step | JC samples have higher overall Score and biological variability metrics  |
| scib differs integrated and un-integrated datasets |  Reyfman data: unintegrated vs integrated   | Integrated datasets are ranked higher than un-integrated |
| high throughput data is available to be processed by scib without issues|  dataset that contains big ammount of cells | scib doesn't break when analysing large data|
